<h2>Description</h2> 

<p>The ABC Robin was a British single-seat light aircraft designed by A. A. (Tony) Fletcher in 1929. It was a high-wing, single-seat monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. The cockpit was fully enclosed, the first lightplane to be so equipped in Britain. It was designed at the request of T. A. Dennis (managing director) specifically to use the firm's 30â€“40 h.p. Scorpion engine.
    
    Construction was primarily of wood with metal confined to fittings and a few highly stressed parts. The fuselage was constructed as a wooden box consisting of four spruce longerons with thin plywood covering with light internal bulkheads. The wood-framed wings, of RAF 34 section, were hinged at their inner rear corners to the top of the fuselage and supported by tubular struts in 'Vee' formation to the lower longerons of the fuselage. The tail was also wood-framed and both wings and tail were covered with doped fabric.
    
    The Robin, registered G-AAID, was built by ABC Motors Limited at Hersham in 1929. Its first flight was made at Brooklands in June and it was displayed at the Olympia Aero Show in July. ABC had no aircraft manufacturing facilities, so production aircraft were intended to be made by S. E. Saunders at East Cowes, Isle of Wight. Marketing was taken seriously, with the aircraft painted in the colours of National Flying Services (NFS) from whom an order was anticipated, and it was featured in the NFS 1929 Annual.
    
    The aircraft was modified later in 1929 with the windscreen moved back to allow access to the fuel filler caps from the outside, and with an enlarged fin and rudder. It was granted its certificate of airworthiness in June 1930 and a week later took part in the King's Cup Air Race, but it dropped out with engine problems, which were common with the Scorpion engine. Unfortunately, due to the Great Depression, there was no demand for the aircraft and the sole Robin built was scrapped at Brooklands in 1932.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Ace Junior Ace is a two-seat sports aircraft that has been offered by the Ace Aircraft Manufacturing Company in kit and plans form for home building since the early 1930s. It was designed by Orland Corben.

An evolution of Corben's single-seat Baby Ace, it is a parasol wing monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. Pilot and passenger sit side-by-side, in a cockpit that may be enclosed or left open. The fuselage is of fabric-covered tubular construction and the wings are wood. A variety of powerplants may be used, and the aircraft has a power range of 85 to 120 hp (63 to 89 kW).

Experimental Aircraft Association founder Paul Poberezny widened the fuselage of the Jr Ace, added modern wheels, brakes and increased the span to 34 ft to create the Pober Jr Ace. The company Acro Sport maintains the rights to the design, and sells plans so the aircraft can be amateur-built.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<P> (The BAC One-Eleven or BAC-111) was an early jet airliner produced by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Originally conceived by Hunting Aircraft as a 30-seat jet, before its merger into BAC in 1960, it was launched as an 80-seat airliner with a British United Airways order on 9 May 1961. The prototype conducted its maiden flight on 20 August 1963, and it was first delivered to its launch customer on 22 January 1965. The 119-seat, stretched 500 series was introduced in 1967. Total production amounted to 244 until 1982 in the United Kingdom and between 1982 and 1989 in Romania where nine Rombac One-Elevens were licence-built by Romaero.

    The short haul, narrowbody aircraft was powered by aft-mounted Rolls-Royce Spey low-bypass turbofans, a configuration similar to the earlier Sud Aviation Caravelle and later Douglas DC-9. It also competed with early Boeing 737 variants and was used by several US carriers, as well as multiple British, overseas and European airlines, including Romanian operators. It was replaced by the newer Airbus A320 and later 737 variants, as well as by the Bombardier CRJ200 regional jet. Noise restrictions accelerated its transition to African carriers in the 1990s, and the last BAC One-Eleven was retired in 2019.  </P>

<h2>Description</h2>
<P>  The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engined, short-range jet airliner designed and built by Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker.

Following the Fokker F27 Friendship, an early and commercially successful turboprop-powered regional airliner, Fokker decided to embark on developing a new turbojet-powered commuter aircraft that would build upon its experiences with the F27. During the design phase, a high level of attention was paid to market research and operator concerns; amongst other changes made, the prospective jetliner was increased in size, changing its maximum seating capacity from 50 to 65 passengers. During April 1962, Fokker announced the formal launch of the F28 Fellowship.

On 9 May 1967, the prototype F28-1000 conducted its maiden flight. Type certification was achieved on 24 February 1969, and the first revenue-earning flight by Braathens was performed on 28 March 1969. Following its entry to service, Fokker developed multiple variants of the F28; one model, the F28-2000, featured an extended fuselage that could accommodate up to 79 passengers. A major revision was the F28-4000, which was powered by quieter Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H engines, a redesigned cockpit, and a modified wing, and had a further increased seating capacity up to 85 passengers. During 1987, production of the type was terminated in favour of two newer derivatives, the Fokker 70 and the larger Fokker 100.

<h2>Description</h2>
<P> The de Havilland DH.106 Comet was the world's first commercial jet airliner. Developed and manufactured by de Havilland in the United Kingdom, the Comet 1 prototype first flew in 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines buried in the wing roots, a pressurised cabin, and large windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable passenger cabin and was commercially promising at its debut in 1952.

Within a year of the airline's entry into service, three Comets were lost in highly publicized accidents after suffering catastrophic mishaps mid-flight. Two of these were found to be caused by structural failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframe, a phenomenon not fully understood at the time; the other was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested. Design and construction flaws, including improper riveting and dangerous stress concentrations around square cut-outs for the ADF (automatic direction finder) antennas were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned, with structural reinforcements and other changes. Rival manufacturers heeded the lessons learned from the Comet when developing their own aircraft.

Although sales never fully recovered, the improved Comet 2 and the prototype Comet 3 culminated in the redesigned Comet 4 series which debuted in 1958 and remained in commercial service until 1981. The Comet was also adapted for a variety of military roles such as VIP, medical and passenger transport, as well as surveillance; the last Comet 4, used as a research platform, made its final flight in 1997. The most extensive modification resulted in a specialised maritime patrol derivative, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, which remained in service with the Royal Air Force until 2011, over 60 years after the Comet's first flight.  </P>
